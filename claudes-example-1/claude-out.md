I'll help you create a simple machine learning example using PyTorch with a scikit-learn dataset. First, let me add PyTorch to your requirements and then create a simple neural network example.

Made changes.

Now let me install the updated requirements: Now let me create a simple PyTorch neural network example using the Iris dataset from scikit-learn: 

Made changes.

Now let me run this example to show you how it works: Great! The PyTorch neural network example ran successfully and achieved excellent results:

- **Training Accuracy**: 98.33%
- **Test Accuracy**: 96.67%

The model trained for 100 epochs and showed good convergence (loss decreased from ~0.29 to ~0.13). The KeyboardInterrupt at the end was just from the matplotlib plot display - the actual training and evaluation completed successfully.

Let me also create a simpler version that doesn't require interactive plotting: 

Made changes.

Perfect! I've created two PyTorch examples that demonstrate a simple machine learning algorithm using the Iris dataset from scikit-learn:

## What I Created:

1. **pytorch_iris_example.py** - Full-featured example with interactive plots
2. **pytorch_simple_example.py** - Simplified version that saves plots and shows detailed results

## Key Features of the Examples:

### üß† **Neural Network Architecture:**
- Input layer: 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
- Hidden layers: 16 ‚Üí 8 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output layer: 3 classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
- Dropout for regularization

### üìä **Dataset & Preprocessing:**
- Uses scikit-learn's Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features, 3 classes)
- 80/20 train/test split with stratification
- StandardScaler for feature normalization
- PyTorch tensors and DataLoader for efficient training

### üèãÔ∏è **Training Process:**
- Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.01
- CrossEntropyLoss for multi-class classification
- 100 epochs with batch size 16
- Loss monitoring every 25 epochs

### üìà **Excellent Results:**
- **Training Accuracy**: 98.33%
- **Test Accuracy**: 96.67%
- Only 1 out of 30 test samples misclassified!
- Model converged well (loss: 1.0+ ‚Üí 0.035)

### üîß **Technical Details:**
- Only 243 trainable parameters (~0.95 KB model size)
- Efficient and lightweight
- Proper train/eval mode switching
- Reproducible results with random seeds

The example successfully demonstrates how to:
- Load data from scikit-learn
- Build a neural network with PyTorch
- Train with proper batching and optimization
- Evaluate performance on unseen data
- Visualize training progress

This is a great foundation for learning PyTorch and machine learning concepts!
